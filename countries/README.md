# All Countries Challenge

Was bored, wanted to see if I could name every country without looking at a map. Wrote a script to check how accurate I was (had to manually comb through some of the diff to discard territories that are listed as countries from the online data, as well as remove cases where I didn't spell them correctly or in their official way)
